                <p>
                    I’m interested in film production, visual design, and learning how
                    technology supports creative projects. I am a senior majoring in media arts, and although it took some trial and error I finally feel I am on the path meant for me.

                    Film and games have always been a big part of my life. Some of the first games I remember playing Was WoW, Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty MW3, Fable, and the Mass Effect series.
                    A very fond memory I have from those earlier times was when my parents would allow my siblings and I to stay with our uncle and we would stay up all night playing games and eating food.
                    Or even creating endless amounts of characters on WoW with my dad and brother. Interestingly enough I think games have made me more observant with the world around me. Especially as I have gotten more interested in game creation 
                    over time. How does colors, sound, actions affect peoples mood; what can be conveyed in unique and intriguing ways; How do things work/function and what is common sense and what needs 
                    to be further explained. From these (mostly) works of fiction I see the influence from our real world challenges, issues, inspirations, and dreams.
