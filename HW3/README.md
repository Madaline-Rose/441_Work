This is my homework 3 assingmemnt where I will be working with console logging, comments, and JavaScript files.

For the Gen Ai test I put the homework guidelines into a program called Claude. What I immediatly noticed was that my code felt 
much simpler then the one generated; it honetly felt overwhelming. There seemed to be a lot of extra (uncessary) code and no clear comments
or answers to the intended console log questions. The website gave me the index.html and script.js files and they were fairly easy to follow
and something I think I could explain. It was when I opened the console that  is when i was compltly confused -I think because it was also the code for the official
website as well. Another thing I noticed is there was many errors and warnings flagged in the console view. After seeing that I am happier with my simpler version and
definitly think both versions are quite different form eachother. Unfortunantly to Claude I don't think I will be using that resource again.
